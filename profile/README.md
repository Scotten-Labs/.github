## Note on my repos!
Repos created after May 2022 will include a .devcontainer/ folder that allows the user to spin up a docker container with all the requierments installed to develope of run the application. I do my work in VS Code so I can easily start these containers by adding the Docker extension to VS Code. Any other VS Code settings will show up in the .vscode/ folder if it exists.
